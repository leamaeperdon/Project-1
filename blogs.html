                    <div class="text-white">
                        <p>I have had a lot of different jobs before, in different industries, different Environments, and different tasks. From Real Estate as a Sales Account analyst, to a quickly changed career in BPO as Customer Service Representative, after 6 months I decided to pursue teaching, and for three years I become a passionate teacher. But of course, as a young professional, I am seeking career growth and opportunities.</p>
                        <p>Amid the pandemic, opportunities are hardly found. Crisis and poverty increase as well as inflation of goods and services. As a mom and a breadwinner of my family, I have to step up and look for an opportunity that will help me to provide for my family. That's where I start to find opportunities online.</p>
                        <p>Finding a legit paying online job was hard for me at first, maybe because I was new to this platform and I don't have any experience with his new jobs. So I've decided to start in the field where I have experienced. I apply as an Online English Tutor, while working as an online English Tutor, I am also trying to find more job opportunities, but searching for job opportunities isn't easy. Again, maybe because of my lack of experience.</p>
                        <p>To make my job hunting easy I saw some Training to Employment job postings but the catch is that there's a placement fee to secure a job. My frustration and impatience because it's been seven months since I was looking for virtual assistant jobs. I've decided to enroll in this training to-employment program.</p>

                    <div class="text-white">
                        <p>But another misfortune happens. Guess what?</p>
                        <br> 
                        <p>I got SCAMMED!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>But this has not stopped me to find a job online. A few weeks after this incident I was hired as a Real Estate Virtual Assistant and I am very happy with my job right now. They always acknowledge my success and growth.</p>
                        <p>To all aspiring virtual assistants out there, please don't lose hope because there's a perfect time for you to find the perfect job for you. You deserve to have a perfect virtual assistance job.</p>
                        <p>Be an Awesome Virtual Assistant like me.</p>
